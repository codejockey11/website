    <H3>General</H3>
    <BR/>
    Remarks shall be included in all <B>METAR</B> and <B>SPECI</B>, if appropriate.  <B>Note:</B> The United States does not report remarks in the same manner as the WMO standard.
    <BR/>
    Remarks shall be separated from the body of the report by a space and the contraction <B>RMK</B>. If there are no remarks, the contraction <B>RMK</B> is not required.
    <BR/>
    <B>METAR/SPECI</B> remarks fall into 2 categories:
    <A HREF="metar-pg13-rmk.htm#AUTO">
      (1) Automated, Manual, and Plain
      Language
    </A>, and <A HREF="metar-pg13-rmk.htm#ADDITIVE">(2) Additive and Maintenance Data</A>.
    <BR/>
    Remarks shall be made in accordance with the following:
    <BR/>
    <UL>
      <LI>Where plain language is called for, authorized contractions, abbreviations, and symbols should be used to conserve time and space. However, in no case should an essential remark, of which the observer is aware, be omitted for the lack of readily available contractions. In such a case, the only requirement is that the remark be clear.</LI>
      <LI>Time entries shall be made in minutes past the hour if the time reported occurs during the same hour the observation is taken. Hours and minutes shall be used if the hour is different, or this handbook prescribes the use of the hour and minutes.</LI>
      <LI>
        Present weather coded in the body of the report as <B>VC</B> may be further described, i.e., direction from the station, if known. Weather phenomena beyond 10 statute miles of the point(s) of observation shall be coded as distant (<B>DSNT</B>) followed by the direction from the station. For example, precipitation of unknown intensity within 10 statute miles east of the station would be coded as "<B>VCSH E</B>";lightning 25 statute miles west of the station would be coded as "<B>LTG DSNT W</B>".
      </LI>
      <LI>Distance remarks shall be statute miles except for automated lightning remarks which are in nautical miles.</LI>
      <LI>
        Movement of clouds of weather, if known, shall be coded with respect to the direction toward which the phenomena is moving. For example, a thunderstorm moving toward the northeast would be coded as "<B>TS MOV NE</B>".
      </LI>
      <LI>Directions shall use the eight points of the compass coded in clockwise order.</LI>
      <LI>Insofar as possible, remarks shall be entered in the order they are presented in the following paragraphs.</LI>
    </UL>
    <BR/>
    <A NAME="#AUTO">
      <H3>
        <B>Automated, Manual, and Plain Language Remarks</B>
      </H3>
    </A>
    <BR/>
    These remarks generally elaborate on parameters reported in the body of the report. Automated and manual remarks may be generated either by an automated or manual station. Plain language remarks are only provided from manual stations.
    <OL>
      <LI>
        <B>Volcanic Eruptions (Plain Language)</B>. Volcanic eruptions shall be coded. The remark shall be plain language and contain the following, if known:
      </LI>
      <UL>
        <LI>Name of volcano.</LI>
        <LI>Latitude and longitude or the direction and the approximate distance from the station.</LI>
        <LI>Date/Time (UTC) of the eruption.</LI>
        <LI>Size description, approximate height, and direction of movement of the ash cloud.</LI>
        <LI>Any other pertinent data about the eruption.</LI>
      </UL>
      For example, a remark on a volcanic eruption would look like the following:
      <BR/>
      <B>MT. AUGUSTINE VOLCANO 70 MILES SW ERUPTED 231505 LARGE ASH CLOUD EXTENDING TO APRX 30000 FEET MOVING NR.</B>
      <BR/>
      Pre-eruption volcanic activity shall not be coded. Pre-eruption refers to unusual and/or increasing volcanic activity which could presage a volcanic eruption.
      <BR/>
      <LI>
        <B>Funnel Cloud (Tornadic activity_B/E(hh)mm_LOC/DIR_(MOV))</B>. At manual stationS, tornadoes, funnel clouds, or waterspouts shall be coded in the format, <B>TORNADIC ACTIVITY_B/E(hh)mm_LOC/DIR_(MOV)</B>, where:
      </LI>
      <UL>
        <LI>
          <B>TORNADO</B>, <B>FUNNEL CLOUD</B>, or <B>WATERSPOUT</B> identifies the specific tornadic activity,
        </LI>
        <LI>
          <B>B/E</B> denotes the beginning and/or ending time,
        </LI>
        <LI>
          <B>(hh)mm</B> is the time of occurrence (only the minutes are required if the hour can be inferred from the time of the report),
        </LI>
        <LI>
          <B>LOC/DIR</B> is the location and/or direction of the phenomena from the station, and
        </LI>
        <LI>
          <B>MOV</B> is the movement, if known, from the station.
        </LI>
      </UL>
      Tornadic activity shall be coded as the first remark after the "<B>RMK</B>" entry. For example, "<B>TORNADO B13 6 NE</B>" would indicate that a tornado, which began at 13 minutes past the hour, was 6 statute miles northeast of the station.
      <BR/>
      <LI>
        <B>Type of Automated Station (AO1 or AO2)</B>. <B>AO1</B> or <B>AO2</B> shall be coded in all <B>METAR/SPECI</B> from automated stations.
      </LI>

          <B>(hh)mm</B> is the time of occurrence (only the minutes are required if the hour can be inferred from the report time).
        </LI>
      </UL>
      There shall be a space between the two elements of the remark identifier and the wind direction/speed group. A solidus "<B>/</B>" (without spaces) shall separate the wind direction/speed group and the time. For example, a peak wind of 45 knots from 280 degrees that occurred at 15 minutes past the hour would be coded "<B>PK WND 28045/15</B>".
      <BR/>
      <LI>
        <B>Wind Shift (WSHFT_(hh)mm)</B>. A wind shift shall be coded in the format <B>WSHFT_(hh)mm</B>, where:

        </LI>
      </UL>
      The contraction <B>FROPA</B> may be entered following the time if it is reasonably certain that the wind shift was the result of a frontal passage. There shall be a space between the remark identifier and the time and, if applicable, between the time and the frontal passage contraction. For example, a remark reporting a wind shift accompanied by a frontal passage that began at 30 minutes after the hour would be coded as "<B>WSHFT 30 FROPA</B>".
      <BR/>
      <LI>
        <B>Tower or Surface Visibility (TWR_VIS_vvvvv or SFC_VIS_vvvvv)</B>. Tower visibility or surface visibility shall be coded in the formats, <B>TWR_VIS_vvvvv</B> or <B>SFC_VIS_vvvvv</B>, respectively, where:

      <UL>
        <LI>
          <B>vvvvv</B> is the observed tower/surface visibility value. A space shall be coded between each of the remark elements. For example, the control tower visibility of 1 1/2 statute miles would be coded "<B>TWR VIS 1 1/2</B>".
