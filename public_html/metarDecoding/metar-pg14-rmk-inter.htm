      Weather is only included as recent weather if the same phenomenon (disregarding character of precipitation) of the same or greater intensity is not reported as present weather. For example, a heavy rainshower 20 minutes before the time of observation, with moderate rain at the time of observation is coded <B>RERA</B>. However, moderate rain 20 minutes before the time of observation with a moderate rainshower at the time of observation is not reported as recent weather.<BR/>

      <B>EXCEPTION:</B>The U.S. will not use the trend forecast.  Trend forecasts are included when a change, required to be indicated in accordance with the governing criteria for significant changes, is expected for one or several of the observed elements - wind, horizontal visibility, present weather, clouds, or vertical visibility. The governing criteria for issuing trend forecasts is specified in publication WMO-No. 49-Technical Regulations.

        <LI>
          <B>* BECMG - Becoming</B>  The change indicator <B>BECMG</B> is used to describe expected changes to meteorological conditions which <I>reach or pass specified threshold criteria at either a regular or irregular rate </I>. These changes are indicated as follows:

        <UL>
          <LI>
            (a) When the change is forecast to begin and end wholly within the trend forecast period: by the change indicator <B>BECMG</B> followed by the letter indicators <B>FM</B> and <B>TL</B> respectively with their associated time groups, to indicate the beginning and end of the change. For example, a trend forecast period from 1000 to 1200 UTC is in the form <B>BECMG FM1030 TL1130</B>;
          </LI>
          <LI>
            (b) When the change is forecast to occur from the beginning of the trend forecast period and be completed before the end of that period: by the change indicator <B>BECMG</B> followed only by the letter indicator <B>TL</B> and its associated time group (the letter indicator <B>FM</B> and its associated time group being omitted), to indicate the end of the change. For example: <B>BECMG TL1100</B>.
