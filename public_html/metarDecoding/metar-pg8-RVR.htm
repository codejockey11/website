          <B>Runway Visual Range (RVR)</B> The runway visual range is the maximum distance at which the runway, or the specified lights or markers delineating it, can be seen from a position above a specified point on its centerline. This value is normally determined by visibility sensors located alongside and higher than the center line of the runway. <B>RVR</B> is calculated from visibility, ambient light level, and runway light intensity. It is common practice to use a transmissometer or forward scatter meter as the RVR visibility sensor. A transmissometer measures the transmittance of the atmosphere over a baseline distance while a forward scatter meter measures the extinction coefficient of the atmosphere. RVR is then derived from equations that also account for ambient light (background luminance) and runway light intensity based on the expected detection sensitivity of the pilot"s eye.

          <B>Observing Positions</B> The location of the RVR visibility sensor should be within 500 feet of the runway centerline and within 1,000 feet of the designated runway threshold.

          <B>Day-Night Observations for Transmissometers</B> The day scale shall be used in the evening until low intensity lights on or near the airport complex are clearly visible. The night scale shall be used in the morning until these lights begin to fade. Alternately, a day-night switch may be used to determine which scale should be used.

    <B>Note:</B> ICAO standards indicate runway visual range is reported in meters when visibility is less than 1500 meters. The designator i in the ICAO format is the RVR tendency, either a <B>U</B> (for increasing) or a <B>D</B> (for decreasing) if during the 10 minutes preceding the observation the runway visual range showed a tendency to increase or decrease. If no change occurred, it is omitted.
